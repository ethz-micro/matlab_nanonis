# MATLAB Library for Nanonis based files: NanoLib

The NanoLib library allows to open and analyze data generated by the [*Nanonis SPM Control System* <sup>TM<sup>](http://www.specs-zurich.com/en/home.html;jsessionid=FCD8A587EE447665C3F4A8CC374671EE) in MATLAB<sup>TM<sup>.

The first version of NanoLib was developed by Quentin Peter during its master thesis *Spin Polarized Field Emission STM and Image Processing* in the Solid State Physics Laboratory for [*Microstruture Research*](http://www.microstructure.ethz.ch) at the ETH Zurich under the supervision of U. Ramsperger and L. De Pietro.
Some of this library's features are still oriented to solve problems related to the master thesis, e.g., *scan_type* field in the header structure (see manual). In future versions some of these features may be changed and generalized. Every comment, idea and contribution is welcome.

## Content

The repository is divided in three sections:
* Manual: PDF of the user manual and source file,
* NanoLib: the library with the different MATLAB functions,
* Examples: dummy files and code examples for using the library.

## Installation and Setup

You can clone the repository to your computer or download the ZIP file and unzip it to a directory of your choice, for example: ```~/myFunctions```.

In order to use and access the library you need to add the path to the directory where you copied the library with the ```addpath``` standard function of MATLAB. Before you begin with your project just type in the MATLAB prompt:
```
>>> addpath ~/myFunctions
```

You may use the functions of the library by calling first the ''class'' and then the specific function. For example, in order to load a SXM image, you can simply write ```sxm.load.loadProcessedSxM```.

A simple example of how to load and to plot an image is given below:

```matlab
% load file
fileName = 'SXM_file.sxm';
sxmFile = sxm.load.loadProcessedSxM(fileName);

%% plot data
iCh = 1; % Channel number

%plot image
figure('Name',sprintf('file: %s',fileName));
sxm.plot.plotFile(sxmFile,iCh);
```

This and other examples can be found in the section *Example*.
